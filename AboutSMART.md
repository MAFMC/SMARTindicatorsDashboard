## Overview

This application summarizes ecosystem indicator data potentially relevant to the Mid-Atlantic Council. The purpose of this application is to help identify indicators with qualities relevant to a particular application.

Indicators are described and evaluated for SMART attributes; to what extent indicators are:

* **Specific**: clearly defined, describing exactly what is measured at what scale and how the indicator is calculated so that methods can be repeated. In the next phase, the indicator can be directly linked to a management process objective. 
* **Measurable**: appropriate quantitative or qualitative data are available to evaluate change over time. Tied to measurable management process objective. 
* **Achievable**: responses to changes in management are detectable within the management time frame--objectives tied to the indicator must be achievable. 
* **Relevant**: accurately reflects changes in the underlying process of concern. In the next phase, the indicator can be directly linked to a management process objective. 
* **Time-bound**: how often is indicator measured and does this align with the process of concern, and later, the management process
within a SMART framework: are the indicators Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely for the priority Council decisions?  

## Methods

How did we find and describe the indicators

How are the categories defined

How did we estimate the overall SMART rating

How did we determine spatial, temporal, and management linkages
