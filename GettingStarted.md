## Overview

This application summarizes ecosystem indicator data potentially relevant to the Mid-Atlantic Council. The purpose of this application is to help identify indicators with qualities relevant to a particular application.

Indicators are described and evaluated for SMART attributes; to what extent indicators are:

* **Specific**: clearly defined, describing exactly what is measured at what scale and how the indicator is calculated so that methods can be repeated. In the next phase, the indicator can be directly linked to a management process objective. 
* **Measurable**: appropriate quantitative or qualitative data are available to evaluate change over time. Tied to measurable management process objective. 
* **Achievable**: responses to changes in management are detectable within the management time frame--objectives tied to the indicator must be achievable. 
* **Relevant**: accurately reflects changes in the underlying process of concern. In the next phase, the indicator can be directly linked to a management process objective. 
* **Time-bound**: how often is indicator measured and does this align with the process of concern, and later, the management process
within a SMART framework: are the indicators Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely for the priority Council decisions? 

## How to use the application

Select a level of SMART for indicators to see how many meet that threshold above

On the other pages, dive into particular attributes.

Do you need annual data for a routine management application? Filter indicators to see which ones are updated annually on the Timing page

Do you need data for a particular area at a certain scale? Filter indicators to see which cover your EPU or area on the Spatial page

Do you have a particular management decision in mind? Filter indicators by potential linkages to management on the Management page
